# Bogdle

A Boggle clone, inspired by Wordle.

## Animation

Animation is provided by [Animate.css](https://animate.style), a very cool drop-in CSS file that allows you to add simple animations to things easily.

## Dictionary

I always wanted a quick way to look up an unknown-to-me word in a game, so I added a quick lookup. Thanks to [Free Dictionary API](https://api.dictionaryapi.dev) for existing!
